# eisti-celcat
Extracts the current month's planning from celcat and converts to ics. 

## Using it : 

### Online

Ask in DMs to add your calendar to the server.

### On my own

Add your IDs into settings.example.json and rename it settings.json. 

> Id is the id of the user

> Slug is the name of the class

> login and password are your Celcat IDs.
